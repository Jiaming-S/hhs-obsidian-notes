Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11

![[Screen Shot 2023-06-25 at 6.40.14 PM.png]]

802.11a (Wi-Fi 1)
- First wireless standard, very rare
- 54 mb/s (megabits)
- High frequency, objects absorb signals (5 Ghz)

802.11b (Wi-Fi 2)
- Sidegrade, not upgrade, rare
- 11 mb/s
- Different frequency, smaller frequency (2.4 GHz)
	- Less absorption problems
	- Longer range
	- More frequency conflict (microwave, bluetooth, etc)

802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)
- Upgrade
- 54 mb/s
	- Same as 802.11a without absorption problems
- Backwards compatible 
- Same frequency as 802.11b (2.4 GHz)
	- Same frequency conflict problems

802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
- Upgrade
- 600 mb/s
- Able to operate at 5 Ghz or 2.4 Ghz
- MIMO: multiple input multiple output

802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
- Upgrade
- 7 gb/s
- Only in 5GHz range: less crowded

802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- Upgrade
- 1.2 gb/s PER CHANNEL
- 5GHz or 2.4 GHz: even less crowded
- High population density areas
