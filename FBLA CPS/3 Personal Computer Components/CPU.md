[[32 bit]] vs [[64 bit]] architecture
- 32 bit: 2^32 values ~ 4,000,000,000
	- 4 gigabytes
	- x86
- 64 bit: 2^64 values ~ 18,000,000,000,000,000,000
	- 17 billion gigabytes
	- x64

[[ARM]]: advanced RISC machine
- Mobile and internet devices 

drivers must match OS

Multiple cores
- Each core has caches dedicated to core or shared caches 
	- Usually L1, L2 each and shared L3
- [[Multithreading / Hyperthreading]]
	- Once CPU core acts like two
