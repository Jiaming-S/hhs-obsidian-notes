Pull cool air in, pass through motherboard, push hot air out

Fanless / passive cooling on smaller devices
- [[Heatsink]], dissipates heat through thermal conduction 
	- Sometimes fan on top of heatsink 
- Fins / grids 
- Thermal paste required for good contact 
- Or thermal pad
	- Not reusable like thermal paste

[[Liquid Cooling]]:
- Coolant circulated through computer 
- Liquid flows through radiator
