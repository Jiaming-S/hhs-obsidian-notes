Always disconnect power source when working on a device
- Some components have capacitor which stores charge

Most computers use DC but receive AC from outlet

[[Power Supply]] converts AC to DC
- 3.3V, 5V, 12V DC
	- 12V: [[PCIe Slot]] adapters, most modern components
	- 5V: motherboard components, most now use 3.3V
	- 3.3V: [[M.2]] slots, RAM slot, motherboard components
	- 3.3VSB: standby voltage
	- -12V: LAN, serial ports, PCI cards
	- -5V: old adapter cards
- Some fixed (may have too many or not enough), some modular
- Video cards usually largest draw of power

24 pins on board used for power 
- 24 pin connector can still connect to 20 pin board

Redundant power supplies:
- Each can handle 100%, usually only handles their proportion 
- Hot-swappable 
	- Replace without powering down
