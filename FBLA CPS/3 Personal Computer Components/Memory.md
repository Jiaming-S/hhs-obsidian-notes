[[DIMM]] connector: Dual inline memory module
- Laptop: [[SO-DIMM]], half the width of DIMM

On DIMM black chips [[DRAM]]: Dynamic Random Access Memory
- Dynamic == needs power to refresh 
- On more modern computers [[SDRAM]]: Synchronous ""
	- Only transfers per clock tick

[[DDR]]: double data rate
- Transfers data twice per clock cycle
- DDR 3: twice data rate of DDR 2 and larger capacity (16 gigabytes)
- DDR 4: faster but increased to 64 gigabytes
- DDR 5: faster but same 64 gigabytes
- All different notch locations so not backwards compatible

[[Virtual Memory]]: 
- Swaps out not-used memory to storage
- Managed automatically 

[[Parity Memory]]: 
- Adds a parity bit to detect errors
- However this can't correct itself

[[ECC]]: Error Correcting Code memory
- Detects and corrects errors
