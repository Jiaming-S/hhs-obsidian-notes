Brown v. Board of Education (May 1954): ends school segregation (because they had separate but equal facilities as established in Plessy decision). Separate but equal doctrine overturned unanimously because (as Chief Justice Earl Warren says) separate is inherently unequal in public education. Overturns Plessy v. Ferguson. This Led to massive resistance to desegregation (in both north and southern neighborhoods) and a second Brown decision (Brown II) which says desegregation should proceed with ‘all deliberate speed’ which was very confusing. Brown led to battle between state and federal authority, between state and local governments, and between those that favor and oppose desegregation. 

Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955): 

Rosa Parks refusal to give up her bus seat and move to the back of the bus to the ‘colored area’ leads the African American community (including Rev. MLK Jr.) to pressure the bus company to revise seating policy. Year long boycott of buses in Montgomery was successful and the supreme court eventually forced public transportation to be desegregated in 1956. 

Little Rock 9 (1957): 

1957: Federal courts ordered desegregation of Central HS in Little Rock, Arkansas. Angry white mob tries to prevent implementation by blockading schools. Eisenhower federalized the national guard and sent them to Little Rock to restore order and ensure the court orders obeyed. The Governor of Arkansas will close the school district next year to prevent further integration. Critics of Ike claimed he waited too long to get involved.
