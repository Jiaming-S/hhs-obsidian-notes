Cold War policy aimed at stopping the expansion of communism. 

As American fears of Soviet intentions increased, journalists often described communism as though it were a disease, an inhuman force, or a savage predator. 

George Kennan in 1946, working for the State Department, developed the policy of containing communism to the areas in which it currently existed (rather than the impossible task of pushing it back or rooting it out). Soviet desires for world power will not soften no matter how accommodating US policy becomes, therefore the Soviets must be opposed at every turn. 

Containment represented a middle-ground position between detente and rollback. This policy will lead to proxy wars throughout the world (Korea and then Vietnam).
