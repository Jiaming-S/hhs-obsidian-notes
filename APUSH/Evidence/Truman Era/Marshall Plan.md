An American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over $12 billion (approximately $120 billion in current dollar value as of June 2016) in economic support to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II. Goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous once more, and prevent the spread of communism. Organized by new Sec. State George Marshall in an effort to contain the spread of poverty (which may have led to desire for communism). 

Secondary effect was the added benefit for Americans of new markets to sell surplus American goods. Soviet satellite nations were allowed to participate, but that was unlikely because they would have to provide transparent financial records. 

Marshall, ‘Our policy is not directed against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.’ In other words, a New Deal for Europe.

Very successful, worked exactly as planned; achieved self-sustainability and ended threat of Communism; greatly increasing US exports to Europe
