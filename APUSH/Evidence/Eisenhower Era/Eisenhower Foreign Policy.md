Massive Retaliation: 

Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles believed the US had failed in the passive policy of containment. They believed the US should pursue ‘active liberation’ which would lead to a ‘rollback’ of communist expansion. They promoted this by advocating ‘massive retaliation’ which dictated that America should respond to communist threats with the deterrent of massive retaliatory power (H-bombs). Not only will this get the Soviets to back down, it provides an added economic benefit as America promotes the use of bombs over ‘boots on the ground.’ This is more cost effective and gets America more bang for its buck. 

Eisenhower Doctrine (Jan. ‘57): 

A country could request American economic assistance or aid from US military forces if it was being threatened by armed aggression from another state. This policy specifically singles out the USSR. This commits the USA’s forces to protecting territorial integrity and political independence of nations from aggression from any nation controlled by communism. 

U2 Spy Plane Incident (1960): 

America’s Lockheed Martin U2 Spy Plane shot down over USSR airspace right after USSR Premier Khrushchev called for personal meetings with Ike. Plane flown by Francis Gary Powers and the US attempted to cover up the plane's purpose and mission publicly by claiming it was a weather research vessel from NASA. Khrushchev manipulates Ike into admitting the US lie publicly which leads to a deteriorated relationship, increased tensions between the two powers, and an end to the call for an international summit. Powers was convicted of espionage in USSr and served 2 years before a prisoner exchange.
