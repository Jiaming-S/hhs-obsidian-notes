The technological, consumer-oriented society of the 1950s was remarkably affluent and unified despite the persistence of a less privileged under class and the existence of a small corp of detractors. 

What caused the ‘Golden Age’ of the 1950s and 60s? 

It was the result of a booming, post-war national prosperity and the result of the continuing struggle against communism which created great anxiety yet also encouraged Americans to look more approvingly at their own society. 

The economic miracle of the 1950s was a result of continued government spending on schools, housing, veteran benefits, welfare and the interstate highway program. It also led to the growth of suburbs as new families created in the baby boom (peaking in 1957) left urban areas and moved to neighborhoods outside of cities. The growth of these areas led to an increase in auto sales and an economy that grew 10x faster than the population in the 30 years after WW2.

Capital and labor agreed to a sort of ‘postwar contract’ wherein steel, auto, and other large unionized industries received generous increases in wage and benefit in return to tacitly refrain from raising other issues (and striking). In 1955, the two largest unions merged, forming the AFL-CIO which helps labor. 

Government spending and a surge in national pride resulted from the ‘space race’ with the USSR. The US was shocked by the success of the first manmade (Soviet) satellite Sputnik in 1957 and launched the Apollo Program in a race to get to space and land on the moon (which occurred in the summer of 1969).
