### Briefly explain the significant events that led to the events pictured above. 

During Lyndon Johnson's presidency, advancing civil rights was a primary focus in his domestic policy. Although legislation was passed such as the Civil Rights act of 19__ and Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education, this only banned segregation de jure, while de facto segregation still existed. Lyndon Johnson, on multiple occasions, send federal troops to protect civil rights protestors and school children going to school against white extremists threatening violence against them despite already being legal.

### Was the type of non-violent protest advocated by MLK jr. and others more effective than the black power movement advocated by Malcolm X and others? 

The non-violent protests advocated by MLK jr. was more effective than the violent protests organized by Malcolm X. Although violent events can startle the entire nation, it invites response in the form of more violence. In contrast, non-violent protests offer the opportunity for slow but steady progress for civil rights as seen in the various non-violent demonstrations led by MLK such as cafeteria sit-ins and bus boycotts which eventually culminated in the peaceful march on Washington to support the passing of a civil rights bill and the "I have a dream" speech.
