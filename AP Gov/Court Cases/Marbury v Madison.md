# [[Marbury v Madison Facts]]
- John Adams: Federalist President (lame duck)
- John Marshall: Chief Justice of SC and Secretary of State under Adams
- William Marbury: Appointed Justice by John Adams 
- Thomas Jefferson: Newly appointed Democratic-Republican president 
- James Madison: Secretary of State under Jefferson
- Judiciary Act of 1789: gives courts power to issue Writ of Mandamus (mandates)

John Adams appoints many justices, packing Judicial Branch with Federalist judges 
- John Marshall needs to deliver these commissions but runs out of time 

When Jefferson becomes president, he tells James Madison not to deliver undelivered commissions

William Marbury was appointed by Adams, but was never delivered his commission
- Marbury sues Madison

# [[Marbury v Madison Issues]]
Was there a sort of legal harm suffered by Marbury?
What Jefferson did was illegal so Marbury has the right to sue?
Can the Supreme Court do anything about it? 

# Holding
Marbury was harmed but Court can't do anything about it

# Reasoning
Considers Judiciary Act of 1789's power for Writ of Mandamus unconstitutional
- Congress overstepped its power in Judiciary Act by giving SC power to issue mandates
	- Power to issue Writs gave courts power that exceeded its original jurisdiction 
	- Conflicts with Article 3 Section 2 which doesn't give the Court power of mandates 
	- In order to make changes to the Constitution, amendment process must be used
- Therefore null and void

# Precedent 
Judicial Review

# Implications
Strengthens power of the Judicial Branch establishes power for Judicial Review: examining laws, comparing them to the Constitution, and establishing it as null and void if unconstitutional
- Another check on the legislative and executive branches

Constitution is the law, not just a structure of government
