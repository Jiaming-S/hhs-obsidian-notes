Refers to partisan gerrymandering (not unconstitutional)

Deliberate redrawing of the boundaries of congressional districts to influence outcome of elections
- District is considered gerrymandered when shape is changed substantially by party in power in the State Legislature after census
- Helps with Incumbency Advantage since district will be mostly one party 
- Creates "safe seats" if gerrymandering specific districts 
- Skews electoral college if gerrymandering entire state

Strategies for Gerrymandering:
- [Packing] people of the same political affiliation into one district
	- By party which has disadvantage
	- With majority-minority districts, packing minorities who traditionally vote democrat creates imbalance 
		- Racial Gerrymandering (unconstitutional)
		- [[Shaw v Reno]]: 
			- The I-85 district in North Carolina was created by district along an interstate highway which had mostly black residents 
			- SC ruled that race-based districting is unconstitutional under [14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause] 
				- The district shape was bizarre enough to suggest that it was effort to separate voters into districts based on race 
			- Also, Miller v Johnson emphasizes that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional since there was a district which had shape that could only be explained by segregating voters on race 
- [Cracking] to make sure minority party has a minority in every district
	- By party which has advantage

Strategies for countering Gerrymandering:
- [Independent Commission]
- Mathematically decide boundaries
	- [Shortest Split Line] method
- Gerrymander to have [Proportional Representation]
