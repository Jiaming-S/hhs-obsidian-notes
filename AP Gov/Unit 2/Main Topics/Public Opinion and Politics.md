Public Opinion: Expression of attitudes about government and politics
- Founder's Intent: tried to remove public opinion from government as much as possible, only letting people directly influence House of Representatives (and later Senators). However, it does still matter 

Public opinion gathered through polling can influence president's actions

Importance of Public Opinion:  
- Can [Legitimize Political Authority]
	- Elected Officials can Claim their actions are correct
- Can make elected officials [More Responsive to Public]
	- Politicians will work popular issues into their policies 
- Can help candidates [Win Campaigns] 
	- Candidates can conduct polls that make them look more popular than reality
	- [[Push Polling]]: used to influence public opinion through loaded surveys 
		- Planting the seed of a lie 

But Public Opinion is not stable or consistent 
- "Your representative owes you his judgement."
- People will give answers/opinions even if they don't know what they're talking about
- [[Bradley Effect]]: distortion of opinion polls since people didn't want to look racist / socially unacceptable
