Laws are all an attempt to level the playing field by preventing advantages by pure money

[[Federal Election Campaign Act]] (FECA): 
- Established [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC): an executive agency responsible for enforcing campaign finance regulations
- Requires candidates to disclose contributions and expenditures
- Limits individual contributions to presidential and congressional candidates 
	- Hard money limit
	- A later amendment allowed unlimited soft money (eg. party-building, get-out-the-vote)
		- [Workaround] for the hard-money limit, was actually used to pay for negative ads 
- Leads to the creation of [[Political Action Committees]] (PACs):
	- A way for interest groups to contribute to campaigns 
	- Organization that pools campaign contributions from members and donates funds to campaign for/against candidates, initiatives, or legislation 

[[Buckley v Valeo]]: 
- Held that it's constitutional to place limits on hard money donations 
- Held that it's unconstitutional to limit amount of money a candidate spends on their own campaign due to First Amendment 

[[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (BCRA): trying to level the playing field again 
- Increases limit on on amount of money individuals can directly donate ($2300)
- Bans soft money which was allowed by FECA amendment 
	- Banned money used for issue advocacy advertising when close to election time
- [Workaround] for soft-money limit where tax-exempt 527's were created where unlimited money could be spent on ads
	- Now obsolete thanks to Citizens United ^c8ae0b

- [[Citizens United v FEC]]: declared parts of BCRA unconstitutional  ^8438da

		- Holds that political spending is a form of protected speech under 1st amendment 
		- Upholds the direct hard-money candidate donation limits
	- Used [[Buckley v Valeo]]'s to hold that money is speech and corporations are people 
		- Corporation has all the rights of an individual, therefore it has freedom of speech
	- Strikes down the time-limit part of [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (BCRA)
	- Allows corporations to spend unlimited soft-money on campaigns 
		- [[Super PAC]]: now corporations can donate unlimited amounts of money to candidate
			- Super PAC's can use in political spending independent of the campaign
			- They are run by people with same agenda as candidate so no coordination needed
