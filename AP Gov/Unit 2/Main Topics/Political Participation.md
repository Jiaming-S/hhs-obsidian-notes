Founder's Intent:
- In Colonial times, only small elite could vote
	- Feared "Tyranny of the majority"
- Will of the people had to be checked
	- Deliberately removed decision-making power from the people 

Framers' Design: 
- President and Vice President represent the Nation
- Senate represents the States
- House represents the People 

Other countries usually have ~90% voter turnout
Why US turnout is low: 
- [[Party Dealignment]]: 
	- Parties used to directly influence people 
		- Providing jobs, Printing ballots
	- Number of competitive elections have gone down
		- Incumbency advantage, gerrymandering
	- Corruption in parties
- [[Difficulty in Registration]]: 
	- Voter restrictions (eg. Voter ID, Exact Match, Use-It-Or-Lose-It)
- [[Political Efficacy]]: 
	- Understanding of how to access the government
	- Feel that the government will respond to your needs
		- There's growing mistrust of the government
	- Believe that one vote will make a difference
		- Low Political Efficacy $\rightarrow$ believe your vote doesn't matter

- Property, Race, Gender, Income, Literacy, Age
