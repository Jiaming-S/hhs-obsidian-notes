Understanding of how to access the government

Feel that the government will respond to your needs
- There's growing mistrust of the government
Believe that one vote will make a difference
- Low Political Efficacy $\rightarrow$ believe your vote doesn't matter

Causes: 
- Decrease Efficacy
	- Policy Failure (Vietnam War, Iraq War)
	- Scandals (Watergate, impeachments)
	- Media Coverage demystifies leadership
	- Ballot fatigue, excessive number of elections and number of offices/measures on ballot
- Increase Efficacy
	- Education
	- Income
- Type of election (General vs Mid Year vs Special)
Effects:
- Movement away from strong party identification and more independents
- Belief that voting doesn't matter

[[Rational Choice Theory]]
- Rational people vote if policies of one party will bring more benefits than another
- If indifferent, don't vote
- People vote according to self-interest

[[Retrospective Voting]]
- Base voting based off a candidate's accomplishments in politics

[[Prospective Voting]]
- Voting based off a candidate's vision for the future and how their proposals will impact your life in the future

[[Party-line Voting]]
- Voting based on party identification
- Swing states don't have much party-line voting
