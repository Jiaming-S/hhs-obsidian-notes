Format: 
- Thesis (1pt):
- Evidence (3pt): 
	- 2 pieces of evidence from required documents(?) that support thesis 
	- Must have line of reasoning 
	- Must use one of required documents listed 
- Reasoning (1pt): 
	- Analysis every piece of evidence
	- If reasoning for first evidence bad, can get reasoning point for second evidence
- Alternate Perspective (1pt):
	- Take the counter-argument of your thesis 


P1 Thesis: 
- Make a claim AND establish line of reasoning
	- 1 sentence
	- No filler/context
- Words of the prompt + "... because ..." + line of reasoning 
	- Reasoning should be broad
	- Don't include evidence here 
- Note: don't go with intuition for claim, write the claim that evidence supports 
- Note: beneficial to write out thesis for both sides of claim (other side is counterclaim)

P2 & P3 Evidence:
- Take both pieces of evidence from foundational documents 
	- Can't take both evidence from the same document 
- Note: try to add brief description when first introducing a foundational document 
- Note: try to underline documents 

P2 & P3 Reasoning: 
- General Format: "{Evidence}. Because..."
- Should elaborate on how this evidence supports the claim 
- Needs to have an example

P4 Alternate Perspective:
- Begin with "Others may argue..."
- Refute with "While this argument seems appealing..."
- More than just stating a thesis, must have basic description with a piece of evidence if possible and a line of reasoning
- End with response to the counterargument 

(optional) P5 Restate Thesis:
- If thesis not clear at start, restating at end can have better fleshed out thesis 
- Note: not rewriting
