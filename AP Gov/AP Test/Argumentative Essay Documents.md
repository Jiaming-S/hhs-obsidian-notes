## [Federalist 10]: Factions
- Factions: small organized group of people with common interest
	- Factions are the enemy of governments
	- Factions are inevitable due to "unequal distribution of property" (wealth)
	- Not possible to prevent factions from being created; can only manage consequences 
	- The larger a country, the more effective it is at countering factions (goes against Brutus 1)
- Pluralism: groups are important in the policymaking process.
	- Having many factions results in better democracy
	- Forces factions to compromise and include minority opinions 


## [Federalist 51]: Checks and Balances
- Separation of Powers: distributing government power to prevent consolidation of power
	- Government broken into the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches 
	- Each branch should have "a will of its own" (job/purpose) and can't elect members of other branches 
	- "Men are not angels" so government must be able to protect from itself 
	- Each branch must be financially independent from other branches 
	- Branches must be able to check other branches "ambition to counteract ambition"
- Legislative Branch must be split into House and Senate since it's most powerful branch
- Judicial Branch is lifelong position so president must appoint and Senate must confirm to ensure judges are qualified


## [Federalist 70]: Single Energetic Executive
- Executive: the President and head of the executive branch 
	- Weak executive is weak government as seen in Articles 
	- A good government has "energy in the executive" 
	- Multiple executives causes weakened authority through loss of respect in disagreements, creates factions centered around each person, and causes confusion in deciding blame 
	- Multiple executives prevents people from leveraging public opinion and prevents people from holding a single person accountable 
- _Unity_: single unified executive
- _Duration_: Executive has fixed time in office and reasonably long time
- _Provision for its Support_: enough power and resources
- _Competent Powers_: power to act swiftly and decisively 
- Legislative Branch is purposefully slow to invite more debate and deliberation 


## [Brutus 1]: Government Tyranny
- Federal government is too powerful at expense of individual liberties
	- Supremacy clause 
	- Judicial branch will increase federal government's power 
	- Congress is too powerful with Necessary and Proper Clause and power to tax
	- Demanded bill of rights 
- Large government results in too many competing arguments harming government efficiency 


## [Declaration of Independence]: Government Protects Rights
- Government must protect rights of people 
	- All people have unalienable rights (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness)
	- Must change/destroy governments that doesn't protect these rights
- Contains reasons to separate from Great Britain (long list of grievances)
- No longer connected to British and now have the powers of any country 


## [Articles of Confederation]: Ineffective Government
- Confederation: group of independent states with a weak central government
	- States remained sovereign 
	- Unicameral legislature where all states had 1 vote
- Powers addressed concerns in Declaration of Independence
	- No single leader, no power to tax, no standing armies


## [Constitution]: Federal System 
- Federalism: power divided between central government and states
