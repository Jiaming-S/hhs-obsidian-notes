DEFINE THE TERMS: show the reader that you know the terms 



a) The most common level of education spending by states in the Southeast is $8000 to $9999 per pupil in 2014. 
b) On average, public education spending per pupil in the Northeast is higher than in other regions of the country. 
c) The state governments in the Northeast prioritize a better educated population and, as a result, the states in the Northeast spend more money on average for education per student than other regions like the Southeast. 
d) The principle of Federalism emphasizes the division of power between the federal government and state governments. By the 10th amendment, any power which isn't given to the federal government or prohibited will be granted to the state governments. In this case, the power to manage education and education spending is reserved to the state governments, resulting in education spending varying between states. 


a) The people most likely to believe that elected officials should compromise are democrats.
b) On average, democrats believe elected officials should compromise more and stick to their principles less in contrast to republicans who believe elected officials should compromise less and stick to their principles more.
c) *Since the majority of republicans—and by extension republican voters—believe that an elected official should stick to their principles, a republican candidate should not shift campaign positions and use the same principles in the presidential nomination as in their candidacy nomination to get the most voter support.* (not best answer; already won republican votes during candidacy; need to appeal to all voters during general election)
d) With every bill that Congress attempts to pass, the president has the power to veto the bill and send it back to Congress without being passed as law. The data in the graph can be useful to Congress. If Congress tries to pass a bill which isn't perfectly aligned with the president's positions, a democrat president will be more willing to compromise and let the bill pass without veto, whereas a republican president would be more likely to stick to their principles and veto the bill and prevent it from becoming law. With this knowledge, Congress can determine to what extent the bills should be adjusted to align with the president's positions to ensure the bill is passed while retaining the original purpose of the bill. 


a) In 2014, 33% of democrats described themselves as "mostly liberal"
b) Since 1994, Democrats have political values that are increasingly moving towards consistently/mostly liberal. 
c) Political polarization has increased in recent years, especially with the increasing usage of media, which has resulted in democrats moving towards the extremes of the spectrum and the amount of moderates and independents has decreased, resulting in the trend in the graph showing increases in percentage of people with consistently/mostly liberal. 
- SHOULD GO IN PART D 
- Correct answer: As more and more democrats identify as mostly/consistently liberal, elected democrat politicians will start to hold farther left positions on issues. *For example*, {pro-choice stance, healthcare, climate change, etc...}
d) ~~Political parties, like the Democratic or Republican parties, nominate a presidential candidate and their goal is to support their candidate to gain enough votes in the general election to become president. Through media or other methods, the parties want to have higher percentage of people who mostly or consistently favor their party ideology to maximize the chance they vote for their party's presidential candidate or congressional candidates in a method of voting called straight-ticket voting.~~
- FIRST MUST DEFINE STUFF: eg. define two-party system
- Correct answer: In America, there is a two-party system with two major parties where the democrats are the more liberal party and the republicans are the more conservative party. According to the data, since 2004, republicans identify as more conservative and liberals identify as more liberal which leads to political polarization and leads to less compromise on issues in government.
