1. CONGRESS COULD DRAFT A BILL TO ENACT A PRICE CEILING ON THE PRICE OF EPIPENS. IF CONGRESS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THIS PRICE CEILING IT WOULD LEGALLY CAP THE PRICE ON THIS LIFE-SAVING MEDICATION, THEREFORE MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED IT.
3. SINCE THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES LEAVE HIM WITHOUT TIME ENOUGH TO READ AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND EVERY BILL THAT COMES ACROSS HIS DESK, HE MUST THEREFORE RELY ON OUTSIDE SOURCES TO FORM IMPRESSIONS OF LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH HE HAS A CABINET OF ADVISORS TO SUPPORT HIM, THE PRESIDENT CAN ALSO BE SWAYED BY THE MEDIA. SUPPOSING THE MEDIA UNIVERSALLY PRAISES THE BILL BEING PUT ON HIS DESK, HE MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SIGN THIS CONGRESSIONAL ACTION INTO LAW SINCE HE CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT ITS UNIVERSAL PRAISE INDICATES THE SUPPORT OF MOST AMERICANS.
