Goes together with Article 2 of the Constitution (exec branch)
- At the time, colonies were fighting to overthrow monarchy and build a republic
- Made AoC purposefully with no executive and was one of its failures 
- Also, Declaration of Independence was a big list of grievances against king 
- Fed 70 defends the executive proposed in Section 2 of the Constitution 

Ingredients of a successful executive:
- Unity: 1 person in charge
	- Unity is destroyed when putting power in 2+ people 
- Duration: serves for fair amount of time like proposed 4 years
- Adequate provision for its support: branch is supported
- Competent powers: must have power/"energy"
