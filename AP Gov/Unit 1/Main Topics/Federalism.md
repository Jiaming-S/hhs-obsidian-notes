A system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central government and states

Powers not delegated to the US are reserved for the states

[[Enumerated Powers]]: specifically spelled out (aka Expressed Powers)
- Notably, these are the powers that the founders saw as lacking in the Articles 

[[Implied Powers]]: comes from Necessary and Proper Clause
- Increased under Marshall court

[[Inherent Powers]]: powers not specifically in Constitution but assumed to reside in gov
- Powers national governments have historically possessed 
- eg. Louisiana Purchase 

[[Reserved Powers]]: 
- 10th amendment is vague and allows for different interpretations
- eg. Education, Intrastate Commerce, Driver's License 

[[Concurrent Powers]]: powers shared between state and federal government
- However, when the two laws conflict, federal government takes supremacy 
- eg. Taxing, Elections

[[Denied Powers]]: powers denied to states or federal government 
- eg. Import Taxes, National Church/School System 

[[Writ of Habeas Corpus]]: must state the crime before arresting someone

[[Bills of Attainder]]: anyone guilty of a crime and punishing them without a trial 

[[Ex Post Facto]]: can't be retroactively guilty for something illegal 

[[Doctrine of Selective Incorporation]]: 
- Previously, the first 10 Amendments were ratified to protect individuals from the National Government 
- 14th Amendment Due Process Clause: rights in bill of rights were extended to states one at a time case by case
	- These rights were incorporated one at a time Selective Incorporation
	- [[Gitlow v New York]]: First example of selective incorporation used (1st amendment)
		- Incorporates the "Clear and Present Danger Test" from Schenck v US 
		- So 1st Amendment is applied to states (not all amendments are applied to states)
	NOTE: 
	- Civil Rights: government is protecting you 
	- Civil Liberties: protecting you from government

[[Indirect Control]]: South Dakota v Dole:
- Federal Gov threatened to withhold 10% of federal highway funds if states didn't adopt the 21 year old minimum drinking age
- South Dakota claimed this violates 10th amendment 
- SC rules that indirect control is allowed since drunk driving is related to interstate commerce

[[Carrot and Stick Theory]]: how does the federal gov get the states to do what it wants
- Carrot: grant funding
- Stick: federal rule/legislation 

[[Cooperative Federalism]]: mixing powers between national, state, and local
- Begins in New Deal 
- Subcategory where there's money involved: [[Fiscal Federalism]]
- If clearly defined: [[Dual Federalism]]
