CREEP: Committee to reelect the president
- Planned to wiretap Democratic phones to disrupt their nominating convention
- Burglars get caught

Nixon responds by bribing burglars to plead guilty without involving others

John Dean comes clean
- Confesses to forgery, wiretaps, and secret taping system in Oval Office
- Taping system is public property, Nixon refuses to give it over

House committee recommends impeachment
- Obstructed justice
- Abuse of power
- Refusal to obey congress to turn over tapes
- Nixon resigns before impeachment happens
	- Releases tapes

Result:
- Loss of faith in presidency
- Shows that the power wasn't balanced
- Extension in the credibility gap
