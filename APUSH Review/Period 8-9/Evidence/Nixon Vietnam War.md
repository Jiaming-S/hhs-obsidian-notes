Nixon's main goal was withdrawing from Vietnam without appearing defeated (saving face)
- "Peace with honor"
- Implemented in [[Vietnamization]] 

[[Nixon Doctrine]] declared that future Asian allies would receive US support in materials and resources but not in ground forces

Eventually agreed to armistice with North Vietnam which allowed US to withdraw
- However, there were still thousands of North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam and didn't end the war between them
