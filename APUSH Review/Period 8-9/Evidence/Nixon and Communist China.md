Nixon's administration pursued a policy of d√©tente with Communist China in the early 1970s

- Prior to this, the US had no diplomatic relations with China and recognized Taiwan as the sole legitimate government of China

- Visit to China was seen as a major breakthrough in US-China relations and helped to ease tensions between the two nations
- Nixon's visit also paved the way for the eventual establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China in future

- The US-China rapprochement was driven by a number of factors, including the desire to counter Soviet influence in the region
