Also Supply Side Economics/Trickle Down Economics
- Focused on reducing taxes for wealthy and corporations
	- 25% decrease in personal income tax
	- Encourages the rich and corporations to invest and expand production and encourages people to work harder 
	- Doesn't necessarily work, could argue it works or not
		- Stock market increases: does this mean living conditions are also increasing?

Cutting government spending to stimulate growth
- Cut $40 billion from programs such as food stamps, student loans, mass transportation
- Contrasts with Keynesian economics favored by Democrats
- Notably didn't cut social security or medicare: political suicide

Included deregulation of industries 
- Regulations on emissions and auto safety lifted to help auto industry


Although it helped with inflation:
- 11% to 4% inflation rates
- Period of recovery for economy 
	- Widened income gap

Ultimately it led to big federal economic deficit:
- Reagan's tax cuts caused federal deficits of over $200 billion per year
	- National debt tripled during his presidency to almost $2.7 trillion
- Tax cuts designed to stimulate investment led to increased consumption of foreign made luxury and consumer items, contributing to a trade deficit of $150 billion per year
- To control the federal deficit, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act in 1985, which included spending cuts
	- But its full purpose was not achieved due to supreme court rulings 

Overall: 
- More money in hands of investors and upper class 
- Succeeded in containing growth of New Deal/Great Society Welfare State
	- Massive federal deficit made it no longer reasonable to make new social programs
