Jackson got suspicious of 2nd BUSâ€™s activities: 
- Thought bank abused its powers to serve the wealthy
- Believed bank was unconstitutional

When the recharter bill for the 2nd BUS reaches Jackson, he vetoes it
- Instead puts federal funding into [[Pet Banks]]
	- State owned

Result: massive inflation
- [[Specie Circular]]: order that required all land to be purchased with gold and silver rather than paper money due to inflation
	- Reduces over speculation of land
