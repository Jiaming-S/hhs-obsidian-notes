Problems:
- LMT: Land Money Transportation
- Falling crop prices, can't handle globalization 
- RR were unfair, overly expensive, took best land
- Decreasing inflation 
- [[Turner Thesis]]: ran out of frontier, no safety valve
- Lacked political representation


Solutions:
- Wanted government ownership of RR
- Wanted unlimited coinage of silver to increase inflation and pay back debt easier
	- [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] wasn't enough
- [[William Jennings Bryan]]
	- Gave Populists a leader
	- Cross of gold speech
- [[Grange Movement]]
	- Picnics, concerts, lectures
	- Cooperatively owned infrastructure
	- Mostly ineffective
