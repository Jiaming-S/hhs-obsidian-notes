[[Pre Civil War]]


North was in a better position politically and economically
- Has strong central government needed to win a war
	- 2x higher population than south
- Stable economy and currency 
	- Greenbacks backed by government credit
- Owned most of the railroads and factories in the US
- Emancipation Proclamation gave them moral high ground

In contrast, South:
- Prioritized state governments so no strong national government
- Draft was ineffective, rich paid others to go fight for them
- Unwilling to tax citizens directly
- Printed massive amounts of bills which caused a lot of inflation
- Relied on foreign demand for cotton as income
