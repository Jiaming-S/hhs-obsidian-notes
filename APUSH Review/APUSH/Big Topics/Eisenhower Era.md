To what extent should the 1950s be considered an era of great peace, prosperity and progress for Americans?

[[Social and Economic Structure]]: 
- The technological, consumer-oriented society of the 1950s was remarkably affluent and unified despite the persistence of a less privileged under class and the existence of a small corp of detractors. 

Civil Rights: 
- [[Brown v. Board of Education]]
- [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]
- The Supreme Court’s social desegregation decision of 1954 marked the beginning of the civil rights revolution for African Americans.

[[Eisenhower Republicanism]]: 
- Eisenhower presided over a business-oriented ‘dynamic conservatism’ that resisted most new reforms without significantly rolling back the activist government programs born in the 1930s.

[[Eisenhower Foreign Policy]]:
- While Eisenhower continued to allow containment by building alliances, supporting anticommunist regimes, maintaining the arms race, and conducting limited interventions, he also showed an awareness of American limitations and resisted temptations.
