Kennedy sends federal troops to make sure African American students can attend classes in segregated schools
- James Meredith

Civil Activists in deep south work to register African Americans to vote but are met with beatings and murder by White extremists
	- Despite this, MLK remained dedicated to non-violent actions

MLK is jailed for what local authorities judged to be an illegal march
- Jailing of King turned into a milestone in civil rights movement because people believed MLK was jailed unfairly

March on Washington:
- Largest demonstration in US history, 200,000 blacks and whites marched in peaceful protest to support the civil rights bill
- Highlight was the "I have a dream" speech

March to Montgomery:
- LBJ sends troops to protect MLK's march

However, African Americans were still losing patience with MLK's slow progress 
- Peaceful marches had little effect in Northern urban centers such as Chicago
- Also lost favor with LBJ after criticizing the Vietnam War

Malcolm X took a different approach
- Criticized MLK as an "Uncle Tom" 
- Instead advocated for self defense, using violence to counter violence
- Radicalism influenced creation of the Black Panthers
