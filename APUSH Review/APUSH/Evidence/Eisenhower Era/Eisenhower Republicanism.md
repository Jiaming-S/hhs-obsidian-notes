Business in the White House: 

Eisenhower accepted business minded people into the inner circle of the White House yet had a willingness to accept Keynesian economics and government spending. He had a tendency to limit interventions and federal activities and encourage private enterprise. The goal of the ‘Modern Republican’ is to slow down, not to dismantle the New Deal state. 

Survival of the New Deal state: 

Eisenhower took a few federal initiatives domestically. The highlight was the Federal Highway Act of 1956 which allocated $25 billion for 10 years to build 40k miles of highway. It was paid for with a ‘trust fund’ tax on fuel, cars, trucks and tires.
