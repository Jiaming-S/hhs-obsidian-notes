To prove $P \rightarrow Q$, prove its [[Contrapositive]]: $\neg{Q} \rightarrow \neg{P}$:
Assume $\neg{Q}$, ...explanation.... Therefore $\neg{P}$


Example: "for all integers $n$, if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even."
We will prove the contrapositive. Let $n$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that $n$ is not even, and thus odd. Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. 
Now $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$. Since $(2k^2 + 2k)$ is an integer, we see that $n^2$ is odd and therefore not even.
