Generally, to prove $P \rightarrow Q$:
Assume $P$, ...explanation.... Therefore $Q$

Often, explanation uses [[Universal Quantifier]]s to make universal statements
$\forall{x}(P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$ 
- Assumes $P(x)$ is true and deduce $Q(x)$

Example: "for all integers $n$, if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even."
Let $n$ be an arbitrary integer. Suppose $n$ is even. Then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Now, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$. Since $(2k^2)$ is an integer, $n^2$ is an integer.
