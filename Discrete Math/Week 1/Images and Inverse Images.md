[[Image]]:
$f(A)$ is an image of $A$ under $f$
- More formally $f:X\rightarrow Y$  and  $f(A) = \{f(a)\in Y:a \in A\}$
- Basically just run through the function $f$ through all elements in set $A$ 

[[Inverse Image]]:
$f^{-1}(B)$ is inverse image of $B$ under $f$
- More formally $f:X\rightarrow Y$  and  $f^{-1}(B) = \{x \in X : f(x) \in B\}$
- Basically all the inputs that will return the elements in output set B

NOTE: 
$f^{-1}(\{y\})$  gets all the inputs that return the specific value of $y$
- Sometimes this gets shortened to $f^{-1}(y)$
	- THIS IS NOT AN INVERSE FUNCTION EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE ONE
- Called "[[Complete Inverse Image]]"
