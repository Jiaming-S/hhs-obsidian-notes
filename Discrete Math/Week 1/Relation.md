A relation is also a set. 

A Relation of A into B is any subset of $A \times B$

Relation of A into A is a Relation on A

If the relation is "$s$", we can express the relation as
- $a s b$
- $(a, b) \in s$
- $asb$ IFF $a\;<\;b$

Example: $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5\}$
- Then $\{(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 5)\}$ is a relation from A into B
- There's 64 possible relations ($2^{mn}$ or $2^{3 \times 2}$)

Example: $\le$ relation
- $\le\; =\; \{(x, y)\; :\; x \le y\}$
- $a \le b$ works but it basically means $(a, b) \in\;\le$

[[Composition of Relations]]
- With two relations $r$ and $s$ the composition of both is just $rs$
- $(a, c) \in rs$  IFF there exists  $b \in B$ such that  $(a, b) \in r$  and  $(b, c) \in s$
