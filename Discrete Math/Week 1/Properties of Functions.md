[[Surjective]]: (a surjection)
- Surjective functions map the entire domain onto the entire codomain
- If a function is NOT surjective, there are elements in codomain that aren't used
	- eg. when Range != Codomain

[[Injective]]: (an injection)
- Injective functions never have 2 inputs that create the same output

A function is [[Bijective]] (a bijection) if it is both Surjective and Injective
