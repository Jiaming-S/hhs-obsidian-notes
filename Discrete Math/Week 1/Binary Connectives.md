[[Conjunction]]
$P \wedge Q$
- AKA and 
- True when both are True

[[Disjunction]]
$P \vee Q$
- AKA or
- True when either are True

[[Implication / Conditional]]
$P \rightarrow Q$
- "if P then Q"
	- Or "P is sufficient for Q"
	- Or "Q is necessary for P" (absence of Q would require an absence of P)
- P is the hypothesis, Q is the conclusion
- True when P is False or Q is true or both
	- Basically only False if P is True and Q is False
	- eg. disproving the statement
- [[Converse]]: the other way around of an implication
	- $Q \rightarrow P$
	- Not logically equivalent to the original implication
- [[Contrapositive]]
	- $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$
	- Logically equivalent to the original implication

[[Biconditional]]
$P \leftrightarrow Q$
- "P if and only if Q"
	- Or "P is necessary and sufficient for Q"
- True when P and Q are both True or both False
	- Note: logically equivalent to $(P \rightarrow Q) \wedge (Q \rightarrow P)$ 
	- An implication AND its converse
