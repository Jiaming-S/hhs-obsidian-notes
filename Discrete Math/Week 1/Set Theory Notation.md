# Basics

$A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
- A is the set of the numbers 1, 2 and 3

$a \in \{a, b, c\}$
- a is in the set of a, b, c 

$d \notin \{a, b, c\}$
- d is not in the set of a, b ,c

$A \subseteq B$
- A is a subset of B 

$A \subset B$
- A is a proper subset of B

$a \wedge b$
- a AND b

$a \vee b$
- a OR b

$A \cup B$
- Set containing all elements which are elements of A and B or both

$A \cap B$
- Set containing all elements which are elements of both A and B


# New stuff

$|A|$
- Cardinality of A 
- Size of set A

$\mathbb{P}(A)$
- Power set of A
- Set of all subsets of A

$\overline{A}$
- Complement of set A 
- Set of everything (in the respective universe) not in A

$A \setminus B$
- Set difference 
- Remove the elements in A that appear in B
- Also defined as $A \cap \overline{B}$

$A \times B$
- Cartesian product
- Basically plot the sets with values of A along x axis and values of B along y axis


# Some notable sets

$\emptyset = \{\}$
- This is the empty set with no elements

$\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$
- Natural / counting numbers

$\mathbb{R} = \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$
- Integers 

$\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{a}{b}: a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } b \neq 0\}$
- Rational numbers

$\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi: a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$
- Complex numbers

$\mathbb{U} = \mathbb{N}$
- Current "universe"
- Usually all natural numbers
