[[Existential Quantifier]]
$\exists$
- "there exists"
- $\exists{x} (x<0)$
	- Asserts that there exists a number $x$ less than 0

[[Universal Quantifier]]
$\forall$
- "for all"
- $\forall{x}(x\ge 0)$
	- Asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0

Properties:
$\neg \forall{x}P(x)\; =\; \exists{x} \neg P(x)$ 
- Negating a "for all x that ..." is just a "there exists x that is not ..."
$\neg \exists{x}P(x)\; =\; \forall{x} \neg P(x)$ 
- And the other way around too
- tl;dr you can pass a negation sign through a quantifier but it switches the quantifier
