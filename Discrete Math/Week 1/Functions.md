A rule that assigns one input to exactly one output
- All inputs must have an output (continuous)
- [[Visualizing Functions]]


Format:
$f: X \rightarrow Y$
- X is [[Domain]] (domain of inputs)
- Y is [[Codomain]] (domain of outputs)
- [[Range]] is the set of actual outputs (not necessarily same as codomain)

Even if functions have the same rule but different Domains, Codomains, or Ranges, they are different functions


Example: 
$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $f(n) = 3n$
- Domain is $\mathbb{N}$
- Codomain is $\mathbb{N}$
- But range is $\{0, 3, 6, 9, ...\}$

Example:
$f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}; f(n, m) = n \cdot m$
- Domain is $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$
	- Domain needs to match input so it is cartesian product (all combinations) 
- Codomain is $\mathbb{Z}$

Example:
$g: \{1, 2, 3\} \rightarrow \{a, b, c\}$ defined by $g(1) = c$ ,   $g(2) = c$ ,   $g(3) = a$
- Domain is $\{1, 2, 3\}$
- Codomain is $\{a, b, c\}$
- But range is $\{a, c\}$

NOTE: Some rules don't create functions
$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $f(n) = \frac{n}{2}$
- This isn't a function because not every input has an output
- 3 has no output since 1.5 isn't a natural number


[[Properties of Functions]]
- Surjective, Injective, and Bijective (both)

[[Images and Inverse Images]] 
- Image: returned set after applying function to a set
- Inverse Image: set of all inputs that will return values in a set
