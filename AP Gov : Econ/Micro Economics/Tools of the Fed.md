[[Setting Reserve Requirement]]
- eg. with 12% requirement, placing $100 in bank means the bank must keep $12 and can loan out $88
- If Fed increases reserve requirement, banks have to keep more money in reserve and leaves less money in circulation and vice versa
- Ultimately impacts interest rates: less money = costs more to borrow 

[[Open Market Operations]]
- Buying or selling government securities (bonds) in financial markets
	- When Fed sells bonds to people, money is taken out of circulation
	- When Fed buys back bonds, money is put into circulation 

[[Discount Rate]]
- Interest rate the Fed charges banks to borrow money
- If discount rate goes up, fewer banks will borrow money from the Fed and vice versa
