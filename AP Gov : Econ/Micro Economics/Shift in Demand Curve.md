Shift in curve: when demand changes but price doesn't change

Shift left / right

Can be caused by:
- [[Consumer Income]]
	- More money = spend more
	- Shift to right when high
- [[Consumer Tastes]]
	- Includes advertising, news reports, trends, new products, changes in season, etc
	- When product is properly advertised successfully, demand increases
- [[Substitutes]]
	- Products that can be switched out for each other
		- eg. buter and margarine
	- Price change in substitute will impact demand on substitute 
- [[Complements]]
	- Products that are bought together
		- eg. peanut butter and jelly
	- Increased price in 1 would impact demand for both products
- [[Changes in expectations]]
	- The way people think about the future
	- If people know a new technology is coming, demand for old technology decreases
- [[Number of Consumer ]]
	- More consumers increase demand, less consumers decrease demand
	- Change in number of consumers 
	- NOTE: will not impact individual demand curve
