The extent to which a change in price causes a change in the quantity demanded


Demand is elastic when change in price causes a large change in quantity demanded
- eg. 20% increase in Burger price causes 50% decrease in demand
- On graph: line with shallower (negative) slope 

Demand is inelastic when a change in price causes a small change in quantity demanded
- eg. 100% increase in Insulin price causes 5% decrease in demand
- On graph: line with steeper (negative) slope

Demand is [[Unit Elastic]] when change in price is (perfectly) inversely proportional to change in quantity demanded
- eg. price increases by 15% and demand decreases by 15%
- On graph: line with slope of -1

[[Factors of Demand Elasticity]]
- Can the purchase be delayed?
	- Is the product an unnecessary luxury or a necessity
	- TV or steak is more elastic vs Insulin which is less elastic
- Are there adequate substitutes available? 
	- Chicken or butter is more elastic vs Gasoline which is less elastic
- Does the purchase use a large portion of income
	- Jewelry is more elastic vs Salt which is less elastic
