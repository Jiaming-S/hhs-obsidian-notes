Shift left == decrease in supply and Shift right == increase in supply

Can be caused by:
- [[Cost of Inputs]]
	- Change in cost of inputs
		- eg. if wages increase, supply decreases
	- Like factors of production
	- Conservatives favor suppliers, Liberals favor workers 
- [[Productivity]]
	- Increased productivity == increased supply
	- If workers are more motivated, they are incentivized to increase supply
- [[Technology]]
	- New technology could lower the cost of production or increase supply 
- [[Taxes]]
	- Taxes add to cost of production and results in decrease in supply
	- Conservatives favor cutting taxes, Liberals favor increasing taxes
- [[Subsidies]]
	- Government paying you to make something 
	- Subsidies lower the cost of production and results in increase in supply
- [[Expectations]]
	- Expectations about the future price of a product 
	- If producers think the price of their product will go up, they may withhold supply
- [[Government Regulations]]
	- Government regulations can increase cost of production and decrease supply
		- eg. safety regulations
	- Conservatives favor less regulation, Liberals favor more regulations 
- [[Number of Sellers]]
	- Increase in number of suppliers = more supply
