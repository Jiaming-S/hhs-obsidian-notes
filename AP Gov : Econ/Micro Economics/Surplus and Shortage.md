Set price at whatever y-value

[[High Price]]:
- High supply, low demand
- [[Surplus]]

[[Low Price]]:
- Low supply, high demand
- [[Shortage]]
- Used by suppliers to get rid of surplus
	- eg. day after Halloween

[[Equilibrium Price]]:
- Supply and demand meet
- "Market Clearing Price"
- Leaves neither a surplus or shortage at the end 


[[Price Ceiling]] 
- Prevents a price from growing up to equilibrium
- Results in [[Shortage]] (Low Supply and High Demand)
- eg. Rent ceiling: can't charge more than $x even though price wants to increase to fit 

[[Price Floor]]
- Prevents a price from dropping down to equilibrium
- Results in [[Surplus]] (High Supply and Low Demand)
