[[Perfect Competition]]
- Large number of well informed buyers and sellers dealing with the same products
	- eg. tomatoes at one farmers market and tomatoes at another
- Buyers and sellers act independently (no collusion) and are reasonably informed
- Free to enter and exit market at will
- Target 

[[Monopolistic Competition]]
- Same as perfect competition except without identical products
	- So consumers can recognize the different products (like brand logo or materials)
	- Brand advertising for their own product
	- Might be a real or imagined difference 

[[Oligopoly]]
- A few sellers dominate the industry
	- eg. Coke and Pepsi
- Collusion: formal agreement to set prices or cooperate
	- eg. price fixing

[[Monopoly]]
- Only one seller of a particular product
- Natural monopoly: cost of production is minimized by having a single firm
- Geographic monopoly: absence of competitors in a geographic area
- Technological monopoly: control over manufacturing process
- Government monopoly: government owned monopoly
