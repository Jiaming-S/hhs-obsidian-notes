The extent to which a change in price causes a change in quantity supplied


Supply is elastic when a change in price causes a large change in quantity supplied
- eg. 20% increase in Burger price causes a 50% increase in supply

Supply is inelastic when a change in price causes a small change in quantity supplied
* eg. 100% increase in Oil price causes 5% increase in supply


[[Factors of Supply Elasticity]]
- Ability of supplier to adjust supply
	- Easy to increase production of bread: elastic
	- Hard to increase production of cars: inelastic
- How long it takes to adjust supply
	- Can quickly create candy: elastic
	- Oil takes long time to create: inelastic
- How willing the supplier is to adjust
	- Jewelry shops aren't willing to adjust supply: inelastic
