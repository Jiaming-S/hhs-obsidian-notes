In the short run, output will change as one input is varied while the others are held constant


3 stages of production
- Stage 1:
	- Increasing Returns
	- Increasing total product and increasing marginal product
- Stage 2:
	- Diminishing Returns
	- Increasing total product but decreasing marginal product
- Stage 3
	- Negative Returns
	- Decreasing total product and decreasing marginal product


[[Production Function]]: illustrates the law of variable proportions
- Production increases until reaching an apex then starts decreasing
